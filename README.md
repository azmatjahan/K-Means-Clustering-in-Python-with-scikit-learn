# K-Means-Clustering-in-Python-with-scikit-learn
In Machine Learning, the types of Learning can broadly be classified into three types: 1. Supervised Learning, 2. Unsupervised Learning and 3. Semi-supervised Learning. Algorithms belonging to the family of Unsupervised Learning have no variable to predict tied to the data. Instead of having an output, the data only has an input which would be multiple variables that describe the data. This is where clustering comes in.
